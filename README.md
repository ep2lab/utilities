UTILITIES
=========

Asorted Matlab utilities that I use in my other codes. This repository will
grow as I add more of my code to it.

## Installation

Installation requires simply that you 
[download UTILITIES](https://github.com/mariomerinomartinez/utilities/archive/master.zip) 
and add the base directory 
(the one that contains the `+utilities` directory) to your Matlab path.

### Dependencies

A recent version of Matlab is needed to run the code. 
The code has been developed in Matlab 2016a Academic version. 

## Usage

See the comments in each Matlab function for help on their usage.

### Testing

Unit tests are found in the `/test` subdirectory. After adding the package to
your Matlab path, you can run all tests by executing `runtests` from this 
subdirectory.

## Contributing

If you have any comments for improvement or 
are interested in contributing to the continued 
development of this or any of my other codes, you can contact me 
through my [personal website](http://mariomerino.uc3m.es/).
