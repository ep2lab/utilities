[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/85017610.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/85017610)

Asorted Matlab utilities that EP2lab uses in their other codes.

## Installation

Installation requires simply that you 
[download UTILITIES](https://github.com/mariomerinomartinez/utilities/archive/master.zip) 
and add the base directory 
(the one that contains the `+utilities` directory) to your Matlab path.

### Dependencies

A recent version of Matlab is needed to run the code. 
The code has been developed in Matlab 2016a Academic version. 

## Usage

See the comments in each Matlab function for help on their usage.

### Testing

Unit tests are found in the `/test` subdirectory. After adding the package to
your Matlab path, you can run all tests by executing `runtests` from this 
subdirectory.
